= Special Fried Links

== Install

      gem install special_fried_links

      (or use bundler)

== Links but with extra tasty bits

* Ever seen code like this?

      <%= link_to('Edit', edit_something_path(something), :class => 'edit round', :title => "Edit record for #{record.owner}") %>

* Before you know it your templates start looking like php, and God knows we don't need that.
* Obviously the best is to move it into a helper

      module SomethingHelper
        def link_to_edit_something(something)
          title = "Edit record for #{record.owner}"
          path = edit_something_path(something)
          
          return link_to('Edit', path, :class => 'edit round', :title => title)
        end
      end

* Nice neat and reusable.


== So whats your point?

* This plugin allows you to change the calling code from this:

      <%= link_to_edit_something(something) %>

* to this:

      <%= link_to :edit => something %>

* Tasty hash syntax

The downside is that the implementation still needs to be:

      module SomethingHelper
        def link_to_edit_something(something)
          title = "Edit record for #{record.owner}"
          path = edit_something_path(something)
          
          return link_to('Edit', path, :class => 'edit round', :title => title)
        end
      end


Or does it?


== Beyond 2000

It would be nicer if the implementation code was sexier.
